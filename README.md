# OOP-Assignment
# Assignment 1
I created a custom class representing a super hero.


# Assignment 2
This activity demonstrates polymorphism using a common method move() across different vehicle types. Each subclass defines move() uniquely, allowing the same method to produce different outputs.

# Key Concepts Demonstrated:
Class Creation & Constructors

Encapsulation (with _name in Superhero)

Inheritance & Method Overriding

Polymorphism (same method, different behavior)

Code Reusability and Clean Structure

# The Files Included are:
class.py – for Assignment 1

vehicles.py – for Activity 2

README.md – this documentation
